<h1>VART2324 Semester Submissions

<h3>Please make sure you have submitted at least four (4) sketches to the Assignments collection in the OpenProcessing class.
You may still improve your previous submissions until the last day for a better grade on them.

If parts of any of your assignment cannot work in OpenProcessing (for example Sound), but work with Processing (the downloaded program) you may submit them by sending me the files on zip format. (I will explain how on Thursday.)

Your final assignment is open: Create a sketch based on the things youâ€™ve learned.

Submit your Final sketch in the same manner.

The final due date is: 09 May 2019
